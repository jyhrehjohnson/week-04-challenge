Step 1
```{r}
load_dictionary <- function(filename){
        x <- read.delim(filename)
        return(x$words)
}
```

```{r}
valid_list <- load_dictionary("collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt")

solution_list <-load_dictionary("google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt")
```

Step 2
```{r}
solution_list <- intersect(valid_list, solution_list)
```
How many words are in your updated solution_list vector?
-There are 8,336 word entries.

Step 3
```{r}
library(stringr)
pick_solution <- function(solution_list,word_length = 5){
        s_length <- as.data.frame(solution_list)
        names(s_length) <- c("word")
        s_length <- dplyr::filter(s_length,nchar(word)==word_length)
        word <- dplyr:: sample_n(s_length, size = 1)
        word <- word$word %>%
        strsplit(word, split = "")
        print(word)
}
      
solution <- pick_solution(solution_list, word_length=5)
```

Step 4
```{r}
play_wordle <- function(solution, valid_list, num_guesses = 6){
      instructions <- "Hello! Welcome to R-Wordle. In this game, you will have 6 chances to guess the hidden 5 letter word. Good luck!"
      print(instructions)
      print("Letters left:")
      LETTERS
      guess <- readline("Please input your word guess, then press return/enter to submit your guess: ")
      toupper(guess)
      
        evaluate_guess <- function(guess, solution){
          i <- as.character(guess)
          output <- case_when(
            i == solution ~ "*",
            i %in% solution ~ "+",
            i != solution ~ "-"
          )
          output
        }
      setdiff(solution, evaluate_guess, LETTERS)
        
}
    play_wordle(solution, valid_list, num_guess = 6,evaluate_guess(guess, solution))
        
        print("Congratulations! You won the Wordle!")
        print(guess)# & feedback history
       
        print("Oh no! :/ Your guess is incorrect, please input another guess.")
        play_wordle
        
        print("Oh no! It looks like your guess was incorrect. Sorry you have run
        out of chances to guess.")
        print(guess)# & feedback history
```
